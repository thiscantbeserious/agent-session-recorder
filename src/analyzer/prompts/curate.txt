You are curating markers for a terminal session recording.

## Recording Info

Total duration: {total_duration} seconds ({duration_minutes} minutes)
Current marker count: {marker_count}
Target marker count: 8-12 markers

## Current Markers

{markers_json}

## Your Task

Select the 8-12 MOST significant markers that best represent the session's key moments.

Selection criteria:
1. **Temporal distribution**: Markers should be well-spread across the recording timeline
2. **Significance**: Prefer major milestones over minor updates
3. **Variety**: Include different categories (planning, implementation, success, failure)
4. **No clustering**: Avoid multiple markers within 30 seconds of each other

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with "markers" array containing ONLY the selected markers.
Keep the exact same timestamp, label, and category for each selected marker.

{
  "markers": [
    {"timestamp": 91.9, "label": "[IMPL] Implementation started", "category": "implementation"},
    {"timestamp": 500.0, "label": "[SUCCESS] Tests passing", "category": "success"}
  ]
}

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON. No explanation, no markdown code blocks.
