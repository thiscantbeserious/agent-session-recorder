You are naming a terminal session recording of an AI coding agent.

## Recording Info

Current filename: {current_filename}
Total duration: {total_duration} seconds ({duration_minutes} minutes)
Marker count: {marker_count}

## Session Markers (chronological)

{markers_json}

## Your Task

Generate a SHORT, descriptive kebab-case filename (without extension).

**How to pick the name:**
1. Read ALL markers to understand the full session arc, not just the last event
2. Identify the MAIN feature or task the session is about (look at what was planned/designed/implemented)
3. Name after the feature or task, not a single failure or debug step
4. If the session spans a full lifecycle (plan → implement → test), name the feature
5. If the current filename already describes the session well, return it unchanged

**Format rules:**
- Lowercase kebab-case only
- 3-6 words, max 50 characters
- No quotes, no extension, no explanation

**Good names** (describe the feature/task):
- "add-clipboard-copy-feature" (session that plans+implements clipboard support)
- "refactor-auth-middleware" (session that redesigns auth)
- "fix-ci-pipeline-timeouts" (session focused on CI timeout issues)

**Bad names** (too narrow, describe a single step):
- "debug-macos-clipboard" (names one failure, misses the full session)
- "fix-test-assertion" (names the last thing that happened)
- "coding-session" (too generic)

Return ONLY the filename, nothing else.
