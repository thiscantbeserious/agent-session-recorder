You are naming a terminal session recording based on its analysis markers.

## Recording Info

Total duration: {total_duration} seconds ({duration_minutes} minutes)
Marker count: {marker_count}
{project_context}

## Session Markers

{markers_json}

## Your Task

Generate a SHORT, descriptive filename (without extension) for this recording session.

Rules:
1. Use lowercase kebab-case (e.g., "fix-auth-login-bug")
2. Maximum 5 words / 40 characters
3. Capture the PRIMARY activity or outcome of the session
4. Be specific - avoid generic names like "coding-session" or "bug-fix"
5. Use the project/branch context to be more specific if available

Good examples:
- "refactor-auth-middleware"
- "fix-ci-worker-panic"
- "add-json-schema-validation"
- "migrate-db-to-postgres"

Bad examples:
- "session-recording" (too generic)
- "my-coding-session" (not descriptive)
- "fix" (too short)

Return ONLY the filename. No quotes, no extension, no explanation.
