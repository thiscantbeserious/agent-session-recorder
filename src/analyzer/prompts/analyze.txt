You are analyzing a terminal session recording from an AI coding agent.
Your task is to identify key engineering workflow moments and return them as markers.

## About This Content

This is cleaned terminal output from an AI coding session. Visual noise has been removed:
- ANSI escape codes (colors, cursor movement) have been stripped
- Spinner animations and progress bars have been removed
- Only semantic content remains

Semantic indicators are PRESERVED to help you identify outcomes:
- Success marks mean task completed, test passed
- X marks mean failure, error, test failed
- Warning symbols mean issue detected
- Info symbols mean information, note

## Session Content

Chunk time range: {chunk_start_time}s - {chunk_end_time}s (within full recording of {total_duration}s)

## Your Task

Identify 5-15 significant engineering moments in this session. Focus on:
- When the agent starts planning or changes approach
- Architecture or design decisions
- Implementation milestones (started coding, file created, etc.)
- Successes (tests pass, build works, feature complete)
- Failures (errors, failed attempts, issues encountered)

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with a "markers" array. Each marker needs:
- timestamp: Seconds from chunk start (e.g., if chunk starts at 100s and event is at 112s, use 12.0)
- label: Brief description (max 80 chars)
- category: One of "planning", "design", "implementation", "success", "failure"

{
  "markers": [
    {"timestamp": 12.5, "label": "Started planning feature implementation", "category": "planning"},
    {"timestamp": 45.2, "label": "Build failed - missing dependency", "category": "failure"},
    {"timestamp": 78.9, "label": "Tests passing after fix", "category": "success"}
  ]
}

## Category Definitions

- **planning**: Task breakdown, approach decisions, strategy discussion, "let me think about..."
- **design**: Architecture decisions, API design, data model choices, ADR discussions
- **implementation**: Code writing, file modifications, command execution, "creating file..."
- **success**: Tests passing, builds working, feature complete
- **failure**: Errors, test failures, failed approaches, stack traces

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown code blocks, no explanation, no text before or after.
